## Day 2 Activity File: Incident Analysis with Kibana


Today, you will use Kibana to analyze logs taken during the Red Team attack. As you analyze, you will use the data to develop ideas for new alerts that can improve your monitoring.

**Important**: Any time you use data in a dashboard to justify an answer, take a screenshot. You'll need these screenshots when you develop your presentation on Day 3 of this project.

:warning: **Heads Up**: To complete today's part of the project, you must complete steps 1-6 from the last class. Finding the flag isn't critical, but you want to get past the point of uploading the reverse shell script.

### Instructions

Even though you already know what you did to exploit the target, analyzing the logs is still valuable. It will teach you:
- What your attack looks like from a defender's perspective.

- How stealthy or detectable your tactics are.

- Which kinds of alarms and alerts SOC and IR professionals can set to spot attacks like yours while they occur, rather than after.



#### Adding Kibana Log Data

To start viewing logs in Kibana, we will need to import our filebeat, metricbeat and packetbeat data.

Double-click the Google Chrome icon on the Windows host's desktop to launch Kibana. If it doesn't load as the default page, navigate to http://192.168.1.105:5601.

This will open 4 tabs automatically, but for now, we only want to use the first tab.

Click on the `Explore My Own` link to get started.

##### Adding Appache logs
Click on `Add Log Data`

Close Google Chrome and all of it's tabs. Double click on Chrome to re-open it.

#### Dashboard Creation

Create a Kibana dashboard using the pre-built visualizations. On the left navigation panel, click on **Dashboards**.

Click on **Create dashboard** in the upper right hand side. 

![](../../../Images/Elk-setup-2/create_dashboard.png)

On the new page click on **Add an existing** to add the following existing reports:

- `HTTP status codes for the top queries [Packetbeat] ECS`
- `Top 10 HTTP requests [Packetbeat] ECS`
- `Network Traffic Between Hosts [Packetbeat Flows] ECS`
- `Top Hosts Creating Traffic [Packetbeat Flows] ECS`
- `Connections over time [Packetbeat Flows] ECS`
- `HTTP error codes [Packetbeat] ECS`
- `Errors vs successful transactions [Packetbeat] ECS`
- `HTTP Transactions [Packetbeat] ECS`

**Example for adding the first report:**

The remaining steps will be a process of self-discovery to be completed without screen shot examples.

Get familiar with running search queries in the `Discover` screen with Packetbeat. This will be located on your fourth tab in Chrome. 

- On the Discover page, locate the search field.
- Start typing `source` and notice the suggestions that come up.
- Search for the `source.ip` of your attacking machine.
- Use `AND` and `NOT` to further filter you search and look for communications between your attacking machine and the victim machine.
- Other things to look for: 
	- `url`
	- `status_code`
	- `error_code`

After creating your dashboard and becoming familiar with the search syntax, use these tools to answer the questions below:


1. Identify the offensive traffic.
   - Identify the traffic between your machine and the web machine:
     - When did the interaction occur? June 11, 2021  1:52:54.206 
     - What responses did the victim send back? Status 401, 301, 200, 403, 204
     - What data is concerning from the Blue Team perspective?  
       Connections over time and HTTP transaction 
       

2. Find the request for the hidden directory.
   - In your attack, you found a secret folder. Let's look at that interaction between these two machines.
     - How many requests were made to this directory? At what time and from which IP address(es)? 15,219  requests .  June 11, 2021 @  1:29:44  PM
     - Which files were requested? What information did they contain? /company_folders/secret_folder. It contains a hash password for Ryan and instructions on how to connect to company server. 
     - What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future? Create an alert whenever someone tries to access the company folder. 
     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.
 Keep the company directory host private instead of public. 
3. Identify the brute force attack.
   - After identifying the hidden directory, you used Hydra to brute-force the target server. Answer the following questions:
     - Can you identify packets specifically from Hydra? Yes using user agent and url path command. 
     - How many requests were made in the brute-force attack? 15,221 requests. 
     - How many requests had the attacker made before discovering the correct password in this one? 207 requests 
     - What kind of alarm would you set to detect this behavior in the future and at what threshold(s)? If there were more than 5 attempts in logging in, it would send an alert. 
     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.
  Limit number of login attempts 
4. Find the WebDav connection.
   - Use your dashboard to answer the following questions:
     - How many requests were made to this directory? 20 requests
     - Which file(s) were requested? Password file 
     - What kind of alarm would you set to detect such access in the future? Monitor when external IP addresses try to access. 
     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.
     Give privileges to certain users. 
5. Identify the reverse shell and meterpreter traffic.
   - To finish off the attack, you uploaded a PHP reverse shell and started a meterpreter shell session. Answer the following questions:
     - Can you identify traffic from the meterpreter session? Yes, we can look it by using the destination port 4444 
     - What kinds of alarms would you set to detect this behavior in the future? Alert when someone tries to access port 4444
     - Identify at least one way to harden the vulnerable machine that would mitigate this attack.
     Block incoming traffic from Port 4444
